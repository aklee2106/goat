  `Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth 
  upon this continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, 
  and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal 
  Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, 
  or any nation so conceived, and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met 
  on a great battle field of that war.`,
  
  `I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out 
  the true meaning of its creed: We hold these truths to be self evident 
  that all men are created equal. I have a dream that one day on the red hills 
  of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners 
  will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.`,
  
  `And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you 
  ask what you can do for your country. My fellow citizens of the world 
  ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man. 
  Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us the same 
  high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you. With a good conscience our 
  only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the 
  land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on earth God's work 
  must truly be our own.`
