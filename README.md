Speech Bubbles is an interactive data visualization application that takes a user input string of words and renders a bubble cluster representing the frequency of usage of the corresponding words. Bigger bubbles mean more common words. 

### Functionality and MVP
* User inputs string of words and application renders bubble cluster
* Application makes an API call for each word and fetches frequency
* Prefill the input with a famous speech (ex) Gettsyburg Address)

### Architecture/Technology

* D3 library to render bubbles
* WordsAPI to fetch frequency of word usage 
* Vanilla Javascript
* Webpack
* HTML/CSS


### Implementation Timeline 

* D1: Research D3 and configure API calls
* D2: Render Bubble cluster chart
* D3: D3 edits, styling 
* D4: Bugs, and get project production-ready.
